# Javascript Adventure Game

A text-based javascript game 

demonstrating object-orientated programming. To play the game the user must navigate between rooms in a house using text inputs and interact with characters they find. To complete the game they must face the boss (Donald Trump) with all the correct items to beat him.

### About this project

This focus of this project was to demonstrate an ability and understanding for object orientated programming. The game uses ES6 class syntax to create a reusable structure for the main components of the game: rooms, characters and items.
